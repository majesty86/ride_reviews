# Ride Reviews

Looking for a great motorcycle road for the weekend?  Check out Ride Reviews, and let someone who's already ridden the road tell you more about it!  

*Inspiration*

Last year, I did something I'd wanted to for a long time: Got my M-class.  Shortly after, I purchased a 2015 Honda CB500F.  2 riding seasons and 6000 miles later, I still ask the question:  

**"Where can I go next?"**  

There are helpful resources out there, but they're not the prettiest things - the sites I've used look rather outdated.  I wanted to take that same idea for a site and give it some great functionality, so I can spend less time searching where to go on my next ride - and just go there!

Heroku:  TBD (to be deployed, hehe)
